1. Will work. Returns 5, because length returns Int which implements
   the typeclass Ord, which is what max expects.

2. Will work. Returns LT, because compare expects Ord and Num defaults
   to Integer which implements the typeclass Ord.

3. Does not work. Both arguments are not of same type.

4. Will work. Returns False, because the Nums default to Integer which
   implements Ord.
