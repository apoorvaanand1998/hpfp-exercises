1. Tried it. Realized it was impossible :)

2. I'm guessing that the two possible implementations are
   (i) returning the first argument
   (ii) returning the second argument

   So it'd be something like

   f :: a -> a -> a
   f x y = x
   (or)
   f x y = y

   Cannot violate the constraints of parametrically
   polymorphic values once again.

3. f :: a -> b -> b
   f x y = y

   There's only one implementation to the function with
   the above type signature. This behavior does not change
   if the types of a and b changes.
